      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>ðŸ”Œ How do the rovers get power?</h3>
        <p>
          Spirit and Opportunity used solar panels to recharge their batteries, which limited operations during dust storms and at night. Curiosity and Perseverance use MMRTGs (Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators), which convert heat from radioactive decay into electricityâ€”providing longer, more consistent power.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>ðŸ“¡ How are the rovers controlled?</h3>
        <p>
          Rovers receive daily command sequences sent from Earth via the Deep Space Network. However, due to the long signal delay (up to 20 minutes), they are programmed to operate semi-autonomously, using onboard sensors and software to carry out tasks safely.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>ðŸ“¸ Can the rovers send back video footage?</h3>
        <p>
          Not exactly. Due to bandwidth limitations, rovers primarily send still images and short animated sequences. These are high-resolution and can be compiled into video-like presentations on Earth.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>ðŸ§ª What scientific tools do the rovers carry?</h3>
        <p>
          Each rover is equipped with instruments like spectrometers, drills, sample caching systems, cameras, and environmental sensors. Perseverance, for example, has instruments that analyze rock composition and search for signs of ancient microbial life.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>ðŸ§­ How long do rovers last?</h3>
        <p>
          Though their primary missions are typically 90 to 687 Earth days, many exceed expectations. Opportunity lasted nearly 15 years, and Curiosity is still active more than a decade after landing.
