    <h2>Peer Review </h2>
  <p>I thought Mitch's Mars Rover website was really solid overall. The layout was clean and easy to follow, especially with the dark theme and how the images were used to highlight each rover. At some points I felt the font was harder to read but that might just be my preference. I liked how the homepage gave a good intro without being too cluttered, and each mission had its own section with timelines and photos that made the info feel more engaging. The design felt modern, and the use of accessibility-friendly elements showed good attention to detail. If I had to suggest anything, maybe a little more interactivity or animation could have made it even more dynamic, but as it stands, it’s informative, well-structured, and visually polished.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>Progressive enhancement is a web design approach that focuses on building a solid foundation first—like clean HTML content—then adding layers of styling and interactivity on top with CSS and JavaScript. This ensures that the website remains functional and accessible even on older browsers or devices with limited capabilities. It’s important in modern web development because not everyone uses the latest technology, and this approach helps create inclusive, reliable experiences for all users.</p>
